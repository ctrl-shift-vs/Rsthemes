# Rsthemes

These themes are supported by Posit (formerly RStudio).

The code has been adapted from a theme I downloaded from rsthemes package (https://github.com/gadenbuie/rsthemes).

These themese work well in MacOS. There may be some issues when using these themes in Windows. I have not tried them in Linux.

If you find any issues, please share.

The colours have been meticulously selected to be cohesive with the rest of the theme of the operating system. Different colours have been defined for various parts of the code to make distinguish themselves from rest of the code.

`#` has been added to make it easier to switch themes at different times of the day as they will appear at the top of the list in the appearance section of RStudio.
