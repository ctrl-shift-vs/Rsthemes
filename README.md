# Rsthemes

These themes are supported by Posit (formerly RStudio).

The code has been adapted from a theme I downloaded from rsthemes package (https://github.com/gadenbuie/rsthemes).

There may be some issues when using these themes in Windows. These themese work well in MacOS. I have not tried them in Linux.

If you find any issues, please share.
