# Rsthemes

These themes are supported by Posit (formerly RStudio).

The code has been adapted from a theme I downloaded from rsthemes package (https://github.com/gadenbuie/rsthemes).

These themese work well in MacOS. There may be some issues when using these themes in Windows. I have not tried them in Linux.

If you find any issues, please share.
